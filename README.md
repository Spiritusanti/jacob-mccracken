# Personal Website
## purpose:
Needed a new portfolio site that is easier to update than my current hard-coded portfolio (https://spiritusanti.github.io/JacobMcCracken/). The goal of this new site is to allow for faster updating by leveraging the power of a CMS, Prismic in this case. 

## Technologies used:
Next.Js, TypeScript, Prismic, and Netlify.
